       "['On 12/27/19 Mike Brock with Sulphur River Exploration called the Kilgore District office to report a spill from a ruptured injection line. The rupture caused the release of approximately 2 bbls of oil and 400 bbls of PW, the cause of the rupture is unknown at this time. The rupture occurred at gps location N 33.280661 / W -95.628041.  Fluids entered a bar ditch and migrated NW approximately 300 feet and entered Moore Creek at gps location N 33.282566 / W -95.628728. Genesis Endeavor has been contracted to clean up the spill. Cleanup crew and equipment consist of 12 personnel, 1 backhoe and several transports. The migration path is being flushed with fresh water and recovered at the endpoint. There are small patches of oil along the path which is being removed with absorbent pads. Field inspector Chase Petree responded to the call and reported a small odor of H2S but the concentration was below 10 ppm. 12/31/19 Cleanup is complete.',\n",
       " 'A public caller/landowner contacted the operator @ 3:00 PM on 1-5-2020, who stated that saltwater was leaking from a 4\" PVC gathering line (pin-hole leaks).  The operator contacted the RRC Kilgore Dist Office @ 9:00 AM on 1-6-2020.  The operator estimates +/- 680 barrels of saltwater was released and had entered the landowners pond (178,000 ppm salinity).  Operator has a crew on location who are flushing and recovering fluid.  The operator also worked at the site during last night.  Today, when the Kilgore Dist Office Inspector reached the site, he discovered two other leak points along with two additional ponds that had been affected (53,000 ppm & unmeasurable overload ppm levels).  At this time, it is unknown whether all three leak points have a common shared source, or if they have different leak sources.  No fish kills have been observed at this time.',\n",
